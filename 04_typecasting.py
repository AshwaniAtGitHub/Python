    1. Explicit conversion

    The conversion of one data type into another data type, done via developer's or progammer's intervention or manually as per the requirement, is known as explicit type conversion.

    It can be achieved with the help of Python's build-in type conversion functions such as int(), float(), hex(), oct(), str(), etc.
