# Sometimes the programmer needs to check the evaluation of certain expression(s), whether the expression(s) evaluate to True or False. If the expression evaluates to False, then the program execution follows a different path than it would have if the expression had evaluated to True.

# Based on this, the conditional statements are further classified into following types:

# if
# if-else
# if-else-elif
# nested if-else-elif.


a = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("Your age is:", a)

# Conditional operators 
# >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

if(a>18):
  print("You can drive")
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("You cannot drive")
  print("No")
